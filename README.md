## Hi, I'm Malte 👋

🎓 I'm currently a doctorate candidate focusing on **variability modelling in the Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS)** domain. 
My research explores how to better manage consistency and adaptability in modern production systems using model-driven engineering and software product line techniques.
